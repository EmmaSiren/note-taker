## **Description**
I have been able to further practice using Node and its many packages available by creating a note taker application. After being introduced to Express.js I was able to use the Get/Put/Post routes to create an application where a user can add notes to an existing JSON file that will update as they enter more notes. As this was a refactoring assignment, I had the front end application available to me. It was definitely a challenge not only writing the back end but making sure it connected correctly with all the functionality available to the user from the front end. Pathing and exporting modules was an ordeal I had to be very careful of doing correctly in order to connect front and back end. 
 
Finally, I learned how to deploy this application to Heroku using GitBash commands.
